## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

plot_data <- marshall_filter %>% filter(year >= 1975, year <= 2015)  %>%  group_by(region, year) %>%
        summarise(custom = sum(rape_sum), na.rm = TRUE)
      plot_data %>% 
        plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~custom, type = 'scatter', 
                mode = "lines+markers", split = ~region,  text = ~paste("Total Crime In ", region))

```




## Including Plots
```{r}
marshall_states <- marshall_filter %>% 
 # select(region,code,year) %>% 
  group_by(region,code) %>% summarise()


states <- read_csv("states.csv")



new_data <- left_join(marshall_filter,states,by="code")

new_data1 <- new_data %>% group_by(coast, year,coast) %>% summarise(pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE), rape = sum(rape_sum, na.rm = TRUE), assault = sum(agg_ass_sum, na.rm = TRUE),
robbery = sum(rob_sum, na.rm = TRUE), homicide = sum(homs_sum, na.rm = TRUE), violent = sum(violent_crime, na.rm = TRUE))


new_data1 %>% 
        plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~violent, type = 'scatter', 
                mode = "lines+markers", split = ~coast,  text = ~paste("Total Crime In "))


new_data1 %>% 
        plot_ly(x = ~year, y = ~violent, type = 'scatter', 
                mode = "lines+markers", split = ~coast,  text = ~paste("Total Crime In "))

```


```{r}
p <- plot_ly(new_data1, y = ~violent, color = ~coast, type = "box")

p
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
