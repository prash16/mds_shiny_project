Crime Analysis US : Shiny app 


Is crime in America rising or falling? The answer is not nearly as simple as politicians make it out to be, because of how the FBI collects crime data from the countryâ€™s more than 18,000 police agencies. Even at their best, national estimates can be inconsistent and out of date, as the FBI takes months or years to piece together reports from those agencies that choose to participate in the voluntary program.

To try to fill this gap, The Marshall Project collected and analyzed more than 40 years of data on the most serious violent crimes in 68 police jurisdictions. We obtained 2015 reports, which have yet to be released by the FBI, directly from 61 of them. Our resulting analysis found that violent crime in these cities and counties rose 4 percent last year.


 I tried visualizing the stats and give a a user friendly interface. User can compare crime between different US regions or differnt cities.
